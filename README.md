# 🌫️ Air Pollution Classification Project

This project presents a machine learning classification approach to predict air pollution severity using environmental data. The goal is to assist in early detection and mitigation of harmful pollution levels through data-driven insights.

## 📌 Objective
To build and evaluate classification models that can predict air quality categories based on various environmental and pollutant indicators.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset (`Classification_Project_pollution_dataset.csv`) contains records of atmospheric data with the following key features:

- **Pollutant levels** (e.g., PM2.5, PM10, NO2)
- **Meteorological data** (e.g., temperature, humidity)
- **Timestamps** (date, time)
- **Target label**: Categorical pollution level (e.g., Good, Moderate, Unhealthy)

## 🧪 Methodology

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Encoding categorical variables
   - Feature scaling

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualizing pollutant trends
   - Correlation heatmaps
   - Class distribution analysis

3. **Model Training**
   - Classification algorithms tested:
     - Logistic Regression
     - Decision Tree
     - Random Forest
     - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
   - Cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
   - Confusion Matrix

## 📊 Results

The models were compared based on standard metrics to identify the most accurate classifier for pollution prediction. The final model showed promising results in classifying pollution categories accurately.
